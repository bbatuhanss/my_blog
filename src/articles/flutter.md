3. Add Flutter to your system's PATH variable.
   
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the `flutter doctor` command to check your installation.

## Creating Your First Flutter Application

Once you have successfully installed Flutter, you are ready to create your first application. Here are the steps:

1. Create a folder and navigate into it.
   
2. Run the command `flutter create my_first_app` in your terminal or command prompt to create a new Flutter project.
   
3. Navigate to the directory of your project and open a code editor.
   
4. Open the `lib/main.dart` file of your project and change its content as follows:


---

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My First Flutter App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello, World!'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```


You can now run your application! Run the command flutter run in your terminal while in the project directory and observe your application.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first Flutter application. Now, you can customize this application as you wish and dive deeper into the world of Flutter.
